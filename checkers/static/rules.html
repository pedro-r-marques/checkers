                <dd>The game is played on a 8x8 board with 12 pieces for each player.
                    Pieces (Men) can move forward diagonaly to an empty adajacent square.
                    If an adajacent square on either diagnonal is occupied by an
                    opponent's piece and there is an empty square behind it on the same
                    diagonal, the piece jumps over the opponent piece capturing it.
                    If from that position a subsequent capture is possible, it executed
                    in the same turn. Capture moves are mandatory. When multiple capture
                    moves are available, the player must choose the highest number
                    of captures.

                    When a Man reaches the top row of the board, it is promoted to a
                    King. Kings can move in both directions and more than one square
                    at a time. This is known as a "flying kings" rule.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    This rule set follows the variant commonly known as Spanish Draughts.
